# Final Project Details

Your final project will involve abstracting themes from the readings you do each week and producing an original critique on one or a few aspects of intelligence. You have two options in terms of choosing the final project:

1. You can choose to review and sythesize the literature on one particular aspect of intelligence discussed in class (e.g., language, vision, babies, animals, etc.), and propose a novel study to follow-up on current work in the area.
2. You can pick an animal/species, an example of AI from pop culture or the real world and demonstrate how and why it is close to or far from artificial general intelligence using a framework we have discussed in class. 

For **either** option, you will need to:

1. Meet with me to discuss the general direction you want to pursue
2. Write a 10-page, double-spaced paper in Times New Roman font using APA style
3. Present a synopsis of your paper on the last day of class in the 3-minute-thesis format

## How will my work be evaluated?

Your final project is worth 20% of your total grade. The project will be evaluated in the following stages:

1. Literature review/reading list on your chosen topic (5 points)
2. Paper outline (5 points)
3. First draft of your paper (3 points)
4. Your final paper (7 points)

Rubrics for each component will be posted on Canvas.
